# Task 5: uploading to the web

To publish your prototype, you must:

- push your prototype to the remote GitHub repo
- deploy your site

## Push prototype to GitHub

These instructions assume that you have prototype changes ready to push to GitHub.

To push your prototype changes to GitHub for the first time, you must:

- create local and remote GitHub repos
- commit all changes in the local repo
- link the local repo to the remote repo
- push the staged commit to the remote repo

### Create local and remote GitHub repos

1. [Create a remote empty repo](https://help.github.com/articles/create-a-repo/) in your organisation on GitHub.

1. [Create a new local documentation repo](/create_new_project.html#create-a-new-project) if required.

### Commit all changes in the local repo

1. Go to the local repo directory in the command line.

1. Make the created local repo into a Git repo:

    ```
    git init
    ```

1. If applicable, add all files in the local repo and stage them for commit:

    ```
    git add .
    ```

1. Commit the staged files:

    ```
    git commit -m "COMMIT-MESSAGE"`
    ```

    where `COMMIT-MESSAGE` is the message describing the commit.

### Link the local repo to the remote repo

1. Go to the remote repo in GitHub.

1. Select the __Clone or download__ button.

1. Select either __Use HTTPS__ or __Use SSH__.

1. Select the copy button.

1. In the command line, link the local repo to the remote repo:

    ```
    git remote add origin REMOTE-REPO-URL
    ```

1. Verify the remote repo:

    ```
    git remote -v
    ```

### Push the staged commit to the remote repo

Push the changes in your local repo to the remote repo:

```
git push -u origin master
```

You have now created a remote documentation repo on GitHub.
