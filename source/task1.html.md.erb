# Task 1: adding pages and linking them together

## Main task 

Follow the tutorials on:

* [creating pages](https://govuk-prototype-kit.herokuapp.com/docs/make-first-prototype/create-pages)
* [linking pages together](https://govuk-prototype-kit.herokuapp.com/docs/make-first-prototype/link-pages-together)

## Stretch tasks

### Fix the back links

The back links at the top of the question pages currently link to `url/of/previous/page`. This is a broken link. 

Change these links so that they go to the appropriate page.

### Link to your prototype from the index page

If you go to `https://localhost:3000` you can see the default index page for the Prototype Kit.

Change the page so that it clearly links to your juggling service start page.
