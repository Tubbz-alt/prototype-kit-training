# Insert a warning

Use the warning text component when you need to warn users about something important, such as legal consequences of an action, or lack of action, that they might take.

This warning text format is consistent with the [GOV.UK Design System warning text](https://design-system.service.gov.uk/components/warning-text/).

Insert the following Ruby code into your content file:

```ruby
<%= warning_text('INSERT WARNING TEXT HERE') %>
