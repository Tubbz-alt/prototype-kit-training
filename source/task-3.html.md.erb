# Task 3: passing data around your prototype

## Main task

Follow the tutorials on: 

* [showing the user's answers on your 'Check your answers' page](https://govuk-prototype-kit.herokuapp.com/docs/make-first-prototype/show-users-answers)
* [letting the user change their answers](https://govuk-prototype-kit.herokuapp.com/docs/make-first-prototype/let-user-change-answers)

## Stretch task

### Use some Nunjucks macros in your prototype 

In task 2 you added some questions to your pages. To do that you copied and pasted HTML code from the [GOV.UK Design System](https://design-system.service.gov.uk/).

Now we've talked a bit about Nunjucks macros, try replacing some HTML elements with the equivalent Nunjucks code.

A good place to start would be the radio buttons on your `juggling-balls.html` page.
